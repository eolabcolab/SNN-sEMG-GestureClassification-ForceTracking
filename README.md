# SNN-sEMG-GestureClassification-ForceTracking
This repository contains the implementation of a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for both hand gesture classification and continuous force tracking using surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals. The model is optimized for real-time processing on low-power FPGA devices
